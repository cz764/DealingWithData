We both work for the [Union of Concerned Scientists](http://www.ucsusa.org), and we’re interested in all things solar—benefits, challenges, and opportunities. Ask us anything!

[John Rogers](http://blog.ucsusa.org/author/john-rogers) is a senior energy analyst at UCS, with degrees from University of Michigan and Princeton and an entrepreneurial past (including cofounding a solar company in the 1990s). His passions extend to energy efficiency (especially LEDs!) and energy/water conflicts.

[Laura Wisland](http://blog.ucsusa.org/author/laura-wisland) is also a senior energy analyst at UCS and an expert on California renewable energy policies. She holds a master’s degree from UC Berkeley, and focuses on providing technical analysis to legislative and regulatory agencies.

Since there are two of us, we've enlisted a helper to collate our answers, but we’ll leave our names so you know who’s talking. We’ll start answering questions around 3 pm EDT  (7pm GMT). Ask away!

 So a friend of mine hit me up on Facebook and told me to get a snapchat to keep in touch, so I made a snapchat. Then a cute chick on snapchat told me to get a Tumblr, so I did cause I'm pretty into this chick. Then somebody on Tumblr told me to make a youtube channel and post some videos up there, so I got a youtube channel now. Then some indie rock dude on youtube told me to post my raps to soundcloud. Then a rapper friend of mine from soundcloud suggested I post my story to reddit, so here I am.

We’re Greg Mishkin and Pam McGill of Market Strategies International. We follow the wireless industry, with special attention paid to how consumers make decisions about smartphone brands, operating systems and wireless carriers. We’ve got almost 50 years of experience as market researchers between us, with most of that in the telecommunications world.

We came out with some new results recently that suggest the market for smartphones and other wireless devices in the US is starting to go through some very significant changes, with lots of implications down the road for what you buy, who you’re buying it from and how you’re going to be paying for the connection. The contract-and-subsidy model in the US is starting to crumble, and that creates all sorts of major questions for consumers not just in terms of their next device but also for the upcoming “Internet of Things”. How does your behavior change when your phone costs $700? What about when your car becomes a wireless device, or even your clothes?

We’ve never done an AMA but thought this might be a topic that Redditors would be interested in discussing, so here we are. Our firm has worked, in recent years, with three of the top five smartphone manufacturers worldwide, the four largest wireless carriers in the US, three of the top five cable and satellite companies in the US and five of the top 10 information and communications technology companies worldwide. (That being said, everything here is our opinion and not influenced or paid for by any other company.)

Link to a blog post Pam wrote on the research: http://www.marketstrategies.com/blog/2014/10/carrier-wars/.

We will be here from noon-1 pm EDT answering as many questions as we can.

At the start of this year I started having strange sensations on the crown of my head. I went and saw a local GP who 
suggested that I was having stress-related radiating neck pain and that I go and get some physiotherapy done. I did but my headaches
were getting worse. I was now having severe pressure headaches, which felt like my frontal lobe was being squished against the front 
of my skull, and the sensation that I had a marble stuck in the middle of my head. 

I got a referral for a MRI much to the GP's insistence of pointlessness. The MRI revealed a pineal cyst measuring 1.2cm x 1.3cm x 1.1cm. 
I had never had anything seriously wrong with me before, let alone in my brain, so I concede I was a little worried. I saw a neurosurgeon 
within the next few days. The neurosurgeon claimed that it was impossible for pineal cysts to cause any symptoms or headaches and that
they were purely incidental findings. I had been weight lifting for the past few years and he told me to stop. He concluded the consultation
by telling me that I probably have a number of 'daughter cysts' and to get another MRI in 3-6 months.

Like anybody I started reading everything I could on pineal cysts from other people's stories to academic studies. Contrary to the first
neurosurgeon's claim that they are asymptomatic, a lot of people with pineal cysts seemed to experiencing symptoms from severe headaches
to seizures. A lot of people with my condition also report being shafted from one neurosurgeon to another with no resolution in sight.
Indeed, that was my experience also. I went and saw another neurosurgeon who was also dismissive and quite rude when I brought up 
the existence of other people experiencing symptoms and the studies suggesting they can be symptomatic when &gt; 0.5cm.

I was suffering from daily headaches, lethargy and dizziness at this point and I was having MRI's every 3-6 months The cyst now measuring 1.4cm. I wasn't really sure
what to do, I was just learning to deal with the pain while trying to keep up with uni work. Until I found Charlie Teo at the Prince of
Wales in Sydney, who I learned operates on people with my condition and has in fact operated on over 80 people with pineal cysts to minimal
complications.

Long story short as soon as I was finished with exams I came back up to Syndey (I'm from Melbourne) for the surgery, which was on Monday.
He uses endoscopic techniques to go in the back of the head, over the cerebellum (avoiding the brain) and to access and excise the cyst directly.
Apparently there were no complications and I'm sitting here on Tuesday night, although with obvious pain from the incision in the back of my head,
but with nothing suggesting the pressure headaches I was having, and no feeling of a golf ball at the center of my brain, nor vision 
disturbances. Considering I just had brain surgery, I think I feel pretty decent.

From what I've read on the internet a lot of people have pineal cysts, but there's not a lot of information from people who have actually had
them removed. So I thought I would try and put as much information out there as possible, hopefully guiding others on their own road to recovery.

My name is Alex Ergas and I’ve been playing video games pretty much all my life and still actively do. I’ve always dreamed of making games and I’m finally starting to live that dream. Currently in development of the mobile game “Combo Queen”, a fast-paced, hack and slash, action RPG with unique controls and crazy timing combo gameplay! Search it on Google or check out my Twitter for more info. :)

I recently got into developing games over a year ago and currently developing games full-time. My current team consists of an assistant director, pixel artist, a freelance sound designer, and myself, the creative director, producer, and developer. I’ve been developing mobile apps for a total of almost 3-4 years now. I’ve developed over 40 apps and have quite the experience in the mobile marketplace. I’ve had a few of my older apps rank #1 overall in about a dozen countries. Over the years of success on the mobile marketplace I’ve been lucky to form a small start up company in Japan to focus on developing games in hopes to grow it into a big company.

Although being a gamer and programmer I like to stay in shape. I’m often hitting the gym and practicing yoga. I stay away from processed foods and have a rich and healthy diet. I’m fluent in Japanese and I’m usually in Tokyo, Japan half of the year every year. Born and raised in Los Angeles.

Feel free to ask me anything about the process of making mobile apps/games, what it’s like working as an indie developer, how to get started as a mobile app developer, how much it takes to make a certain app, the next million dollar idea, etc. I’m also open to any questions about Japan, Japan’s culture, how to learn the language, those “Is it really like ____ in Japan?” questions, health, fitness, etc. I’m open to pretty much anything. Ask away guys!

I'm Emily Quinn, and I am intersex. I have Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome, meaning my body is completely unresponsive to testosterone. I have XY chromosomes and undescended testes, but I have a female phenotype (breasts, vagina, etc)

Recently I came out publicly as intersex in this PSA on MTV, and I wrote a letter about it to my friends and family: http://act.mtv.com/posts/faking-it-intersex-letter/

I also wrote and voiced an animated video that aired today with this article: on.mtv.com/ZSdmCr

I was ALSO on a podcast for the bisexual community that aired today: http://www.thebicast.org/podcast/intersex-awareness-day-with-patti-spangler-and-emily-quinn/

I work with Advocates for Informed Choice [www.aiclegal.org] to provide awareness for intersex people.  I'm also a member of Inter/Act, the first advocacy group run by and for intersex youth! [www.interactyouth.org] I've given presentations to GLAAD, medical communities, classes, the list goes on. Awareness is SO important for our communities.

By day I work as Production Coordinator on Adventure Time.  I'm young so I'm just getting started in the animation industry, but you're welcome to ask any questions! No spoilers! (Previously I interned on Scooby Doo and for DC Nation, and worked on Teen Titans Go. I was also a PA for live-action commercials/music videos/promos for a few years.)  By night I've been consulting with MTV on their show Faking It, the first television show ever to have an intersex main character! It's a HUGE step for intersex awareness, and it seriously makes me cry just thinking about it. Maybe it’s the hormones? 

Other cool things? I'm 4+ year vegan, competitive irish step dancer, and a mermaid. (That last one is up for debate.)

Anti western cosplayers channel [ see how many Asians and Anime fans from around the world who participated and agreed with the movement ] http://www.youtube.com/user/VeryProudToBeAsian/discussion

How to participate in the anti western cosplayers movement :

- By following the anti western cosplayers channel, the more peoples who follow the channel then the more pressure the western cosplayers who see the channel's videos will feel that their action of cosplaying Anime characters are really wrong. This will also cause them to stop thinking that they can just do whatever they want, many western cosplayers who insist on cosplaying Anime characters is because they [ they said it themselves ] think they can just do whatever they want.

- The best way is by making your own videos, blogs, topics, etc which told or mention that western cosplayers cosplaying Anime characters will only ruin the Anime characters which hurt many Anime fans feelings and their action also a form of racism against Asians.

You can also take part by twiting or facebook recommending the movement's campaign such as this one that have got 6 twits and 98 facebook recommendations

IRS Employees are forbidden from lobbying Congress, leaving former agents and insiders like myself to raise the alarm about what is happening to and within the agency. With that in mind, I have written an open, public and free letter ([summary here](http://tmblr.co/ZXgPgq1T-A5MX
))to our leaders titled The Wheels are Falling Off the Wagon at the IRS in hopes of drawing much-needed attention to an ongoing crisis impacting American taxpayers.

I am excited to be with you Redditors today and hope to answer as many questions as possible. I plan to answer some right out of the gate, then return in two hours to further address top-voted queries. Please feel free to read more below and ask me (almost) anything about this open letter and otherwise!

**My short bio:** At the IRS, I was a specialist and territory manager for 23 states. I have testified in US tax court, written several books and twice won IRS Civil Servant of the Year awards. I have a BS, MS and MBA and am currently a qualified mediator with the Minnesota Supreme Court. In my younger years, I also worked for the US Army Corps of Engineers and was a sewer inspector.

**My Proof:** https://twitter.com/MikeGregConsult/status/523167713305583616
 
**Context:** This publication was made to raise awareness and motivate voters for the upcoming elections. Congressman Darrell Issa, the wealthiest man in Congress and Chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, has investigated the Lois Lerner Tea Party concerns with a dozen investigations costing over $12 million and collected over 67,000 emails while not finding any illegal activity at the IRS. There certainly was mismanagement, poor decision making and inappropriate acts by the IRS. These should be addressed. However, while focusing on this headline-catching case, the Committee has lost focus and severely underfunded the IRS. This cripples the agency hurts law-abiding taxpayers who want and need help from the agency – it also allows identify thieves and criminals to go unprosecuted, all at the expense of everyday Americans.

**Disclaimers:** While I can give my opinions on tax law and the state of the IRS, I cannot give you tax advice. I am open to other questions but am hoping to focus on the pressing political issues surrounding the current state of the IRS, its dysfunctional elements and how we can improve the agency for the benefit of honest US taxpayers.

Russell Brand's TREWS is been growing in popularity and controversy over the last 12 months. He has a lot to say - and let's be honest - he's never short of things to say.

1. When will his ""revolution"" start / what catalyst is needed to generate momentum?
2. Are there any political or corporates that you trust and believe in?
3. How do you feel about accusations that while your message is anti corporate, anti greed, you are still charging for your books and tour? 
4. What is your vision of society post the ""revolution""?
5. What inspired you to take up this revolution? Was there a single event or was it something someone said?

While booking I said to myself: ""definitely not want to end up in the north! lol!"". Then I tought: ""why not?"" and looked on tripadvisor for the reviews of north Korean hotels, thinking there were none. Instead, there were and the reviews excellent. So it got me. I started studying everything I could about there and decided that I had to go. So I did. And I booked a biking trip, to get the most out of it and not just see the usual Pyongyang monuments (some of which are worth nonetheless).

In the end I visited the DMZ at panmunjon, some Kaesong monuments, the pakyong falls, the usual Pyongyang lot (war museum, USS pueblo, the mausoleum (wow!!!!) but also a local mall and a local pub). Then we biked to Nampo on the empty Youth Hero Highway. Surreal! Then we biked in the Kuwolsan important bird area and in the unpaved roads in the middle of paddy fields outside Sariwon. Finally we went biking on mount Paekdu (amazing!!!!!!!!!) and the next day we biked along these rural villages up in the mountains outside Samjiyon.

I worked 3+ years as a game journalist (The Daily Texan, The Escapist, Destructoid) until I became part of a scandal when I revealed the identity of a transgender developer in an effort to end a fraudulent charity (read my full, horribly long personal account here: http://t.co/K4kmkgVHLy).

Recent leaks from private game journalists emails have revealed there is more to my story, involving other parties agreeing to cover the mismanagement that led to my decision and the blacklisting that would follow. These leaks came from the GamerGate camp.

As someone who was both a game journalist elite (E3, press junkets, one-on-one interviews with game icons, etc.) and case study of game journalist corruption (according to GamerGate), I'd like to answer questions from a neutral perspective.

I’m Dave Peiser, running to replace 7-term incumbent Republican Darrell Issa in California’s 49th Congressional District. I am a local business owner, the head of a non-profit, and a climate activist.

If elected, I will work to pass legislation that aggressively tackles climate change. I believe that the “Dreamers” should be granted legal residency immediately, and that a comprehensive overhaul to our criminal justice system is long overdue. I am strongly in favor of net neutrality and keeping money out of politics because the alternative poses a serious threat to our democracy. 

I am running because on all of the above issues my opponent stands not only on the wrong side of history, but squarely in the way of progress.

We are rockin’ this campaign with some great unique endorsements. There’s Crosby Stills and Nash (see [pic with me, Stephen Stills and Graham Nash here](https://www.facebook.com/CSN.official). I’m the only non-incumbent south of LA with an endorsement from the National Association of Letter Carriers (NALC) and the only Congressional candidate with an endorsement from Latinos Organizing for Action. I’m one of only two non-incumbents in California endorsed by Progressive Democrats of America. We’re out on the streets talking to voters and making this happen.

I am Dave Peiser, ask me anything!

My new film LISTEN UP PHILIP is now playing in select cities. If you’re in Chicago or LA, come out to the theater this weekend and hold me? I will be there doing some post-screening Q&amp;As! If you hate leaving the house as much as I do, then you can download it today from iTunes. In that scenario I cannot be held by you physically but know that for each download we are psychically in each other’s arms and that means a lot.

Here is the link to that option: https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/listen-up-philip/id925167217

Who were balanced and centered (one might say happy) so that I could see what they did differently that the rest of us could learn from. I was looking for people who were flexible, who enjoyed their work, who valued their relationships with others, who prioritized having fun. I wanted to find people who had purpose, who were grateful, and who handled conflict rationally and with kindness. I wanted to interview those who felt good about their lives, not because they hadn’t suffered (we all suffer), but because they had made adjustments that enabled them to live a balanced life in spite of that suffering.

I found 10 people, including a 90 year old Holocaust survivor [\(found him on reddit!\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1htg1m/iama_holocaust_survivor_selfie_gym_grandpa_ama/), a master violinist with Hepatitis B waiting for his second liver transplant, a woman who lost her daughter to cancer and her husband to heart problems in just a few short years, an activist, an ethical entrepreneur, author Lisa Bloom, and more. I asked them questions about their lives, and how they handle everything from war to divorce to illness to loss to marriage to jobs. The list goes on. And what I found out was incredible. They weren't born with perfect lives, or the secret to living a balanced life. They had adjusted their behavior over time after learning from experience. To me, this knowledge, that we can all be happier and more at peace just by making simple changes was very empowering.

I joined this company when he approached me about transitioning his family retail jewelry business into an online company.

**My Proof:** https://enchanteddiamonds.com/reddit-ama.html

Some questions I get asked a lot:

**How can you avoid buying conflict diamonds?**

To be honest, the problem with conflict diamonds is nowhere near where it used to be.  During the civil wars in Sierra Leone and Angola, they made up 18-19% of all diamonds, but now it's below 1% or so.  And they're not really even funding conflicts, technically, they're just mined by really corrupt companies in a certain part of Zimbabwe.  Part of the reason they're not as much of an issue is that diamond manufacturers have put a lot of checks in place to verify the origin of a diamond.  But perhaps the bigger reason is that most of the parts of Africa where you can find diamonds near the surface of the ground have been scoured very intensively already by poor people hoping for a chance out of poverty.  The diamonds that come from Africa now need to be mined using pretty sophisticated equipment that warlords just can't get.  And the African countries that do have diamond mines often use that money for public works programs.  Botswana, for example, went from having a standard of living similar to Rwanda, to being more on the level of Turkey and Mexico, thanks to their diamond mines.  Although they have a huge AIDS problem, they use the money from their diamond mines to provide free HIV medication to all their citizens:

http://www.gia.edu/gems-gemology/summer-2014-weldon-botswana-scintillating-moment

A lot of diamond retails will take advantage of this misconception about diamonds mined in Africa in order to sell ""conflict-free"" diamonds that have been mined in Canada, Russia, or Australia.  But this just plays into western stereotypes that diamonds mined in Africa are lining the pockets of a warlord somewhere.

**Are diamonds actually rare?  Do they have intrinsic value?**

Diamond crystals themselves are not that rare, but the larger gemstone-quality diamonds are.  In fact, 5 carats of gemstone quality diamonds per tonne of ore is considered really good.  That's one gram of diamonds per tonne of ore.  Smaller diamonds and brown-colored ""chocolate"" diamonds are a lot more common and a lot less desirable.  Diamonds become exponentially rarer the larger they are.  And the determining factor of ""value"" is how much money people will pay for something.  

**Aren't engagement rings just a tradition that De Beers invented?**

Diamonds have been valuable since antiquity, and their name comes from a Greek term meaning ""unbreakable"".  They're the only naturally-occurring gemstone that has a refractive index greater than 2, which gives it some really interesting optical properties.  They've been extremely valuable to nobility throughout Europe and Asia, and engagement rings containing diamonds and other precious stones were often exchanged among the upper classes.  But until the discovery of large quantities of diamonds in South Africa, they'd always been too expensive for middle-class people to afford.  De Beers just marketed that tradition to the middle class, quite successfully I might add.  Incidentally, De Beers doesn't control the diamond industry like they used to.  They still produce about 40% of diamonds, but they lost a ton of money and had to sell off their stockpiles during the 1990s, when they tried to keep their monopoly despite new diamond mines opening up in Russia and Canada.

Anyway... ask me anything about diamonds, the diamond industry, engagement rings or whatever.

We’re really excited to be doing an AMA here on Reddit. Our documentary Beautiful Noise is the first-ever documentary about one of the most influential, underground music movements of the 20th century. It is the story of Cocteau Twins, The Jesus and Mary Chain, and My Bloody Valentine and how their groundbreaking music inspired generations of bands.

We got to interview lots of music legends for the documentary; band members from Cocteau Twins, The Jesus and Mary Chain, My Bloody Valentine, Ride, Slowdive, Chapterhouse, Lush, Curve, Swervedriver, Medicine, Pale Saints as well as AR Kane and Wayne Coyne, Trent Reznor, Billy Corgan and Robert Smith.

There are a few of these on here but I've noticed a couple things about them. 

Firstly, many of them are from people who worked in indirect channels or who worked for third party dealers, i.e. NOT corporate Verizon reps. 

Secondly, many of them are from reps who worked in call centers. 

Thirdly, some of them, I realize everyone has different opinions and misinformation is everywhere, but some of the answers I've seen are just outright false or questionable answers at best. I saw one guy say the $30 upgrade fee VZW charges was mandated by the FCC. Another person said that Apple products weren't allowed to be returned to a Verizon store. I dunno if these people were confused themselves or just screwing with people but anywho, some of the answers were iffy. Also some people answering still worked for the company and, imo, were giving a very pro-VZW spin on their answers. 

I do not work for the company any longer, I will attempt to answer every question as honestly as possible, to the best of my ability. I worked in an actual store, not a call center. And I worked for an actual VZW corporate store, not a third party retailer so my perspective will be a bit different and I believe interesting. 

I worked for VZW for 5 years, have a lot of interesting stories, and look forward to hopefully a good amount of questions. Dunno if this'll attract a lot of questions, very few or what but I'll try to stay on top of it, apologies if I take a bit of time to respond but I'll try to be punctual. Thanks!

I spent 2 weeks in a coma.

Had 3 different brain surgeries including a craniectomy (removal of a portion of the skull to let the brain swell).

Had to relearn to walk.

My ability to talk was still intact decently.

I'm deaf mildly facially disfigured and my sense of smell is mostly only disgusting chemical scents.

High potential for epilepsy. 

Many more permanent injuries that would take too long to list.

I'm appalled that the various media outlets put down what hospital I was taken to as there have been a few attempts by criminals to get into hospitals to murder witnesses that can identify them.

Ask me anything about brain surgery, why this situation happened, how I managed to survive and escape being handcuffed and beaten, my dealings with the police, how this case has not been solved nor probably ever will or anything else you feel like.

We use research everyday to create scientific and medical advances, understand culture, and fuel the economy, but articles can cost $30 or more each to read—even though much of the research is funded by the public in the first place. The alternative to this is open access, academic publishing which allows free, immediate, online access to peer-reviewed research with full rights to reuse the work.

This week is [International Open Access Week](http://www.openaccessweek.org/), and we invite you to join us in celebrating all things open access!
